# ATMproject
A C# ATM interfaced with SQL
A learning journey into beefing up my c# skills, as well as using this project to learn version control and more advanced git usage

## The project so far
There is still much work to be done. 
I feel as I have made great strides in using this as a project to better understanding working in a C# environment as well as fully utilizing github

##TODO
1. Secure program from user input, ensuring only the correct information is given to the program
2. Create methods for creating transactions: withdrawl/deposit
3. Examining any other SQL triggers to help keep the database clean and usable
4. Wrap it all together in a workable user interace
5. Much much more
